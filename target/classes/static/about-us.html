                    <h3>Personalized Education</h3>
                    <p>Everyone learns in different ways. For the first time in history, we can analyze how millions of people learn at once to create the most effective educational system possible and tailor it to each student.</p>
                    <p>Our ultimate goal is to give everyone access to a private tutor experience through technology.</p>

                    <h3>Making Learning Fun</h3>
                    <p>It's hard to stay motivated when learning online, so we made GoLanguage so fun that people would prefer picking up new skills over playing a game.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="mission-card">
                    <h3>Universally Accessible</h3>
                    <p>There are over 1.2 billion people learning a language and the majority are doing so to gain access to better opportunities. Unfortunately, learning a language is expensive and inaccessible to most.</p>
                    <p>We created GoLanguage so that everyone could have a chance. Free language education â€“ no hidden fees, no premium content, just free.</p>
                    <p>GoLanguage is used by the richest man in the world and many Hollywood stars, and at the same time by public schools students in developing countries. We believe true equality is when spending more can't buy you a better education.</p>
